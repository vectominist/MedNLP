üè• üìñ Mandarin medical dialogue analysis implemented in PyTorch.

## Introduction

This is a repository for analyzing mandarin medical dialgoues, including risk assessment and multiple-choice questing answering. The codes are designed for the [Medical Dialog Analysis Competition](https://aidea-web.tw/topic/3665319f-cd5d-4f92-8902-00ebbd8e871d). To reproduce our results, please refer to the [reproduce](#reproduce) section.

## Instructions

### Installation

* Python 3.6+

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Download Data

```bash
vim aidea-web.tw_cookies.txt # put log-in cookies.txt here
./download.sh
```

### Reproduce

```bash
bash reproduce.sh config/risk_test.yaml config/qa_test.yaml
```

### Risk Assessment

#### Model

See `report.pdf`

#### Train Masked Language Model (MLM)

```bash
vim config/mlm.yaml # Set train path and pretrained model.
bash train_mlm.sh
```

#### Train Risk Model (DL-based)

```bash
vim config/risk.yaml # Put your pretrained MLM here. Set train path and test path.
bash train_risk.sh
```

#### Test (DL-based)

```bash
python src/train_risk.py --config config/risk.yaml --mode test
```

#### Train & Test Risk Model (TF-IDF)

```bash
bash run_risk_tfidf.sh
```


### Question Answering

#### Model

See `report.pdf`

#### Test

```bash
bash run_qa_rule_base.sh
```
